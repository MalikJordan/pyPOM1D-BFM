# pyPOM1D-reducedBFM-SpeciesRemoval
One-dimensional Princeton Ocean Model (POM1D) with coupling capabilities with Biogeochemical Flux Model (BFM).
This branch includes the option to perform a skeletal model reduction on BFM using a modified version of the direct relation graph with error propagation method. Species that are identified as unimportant to the model for examining a particular quantity are neglected during the simulation (all unnecessary species are removed from the model).
